****************************** DISCLAIMER *********************************
    I, ±d¤ß«³, personally create and debug all parts of this simulation program.
However, it is not me nor anyone that truely "invent" the numerical aircraft 
model like this one. It is based on the long history of all mathematical, 
science, and engineering of humanity. Like Isaac Newton said, "standing on
 the shoulders of giants".
    The aerodynamical parameter of the vehicle in this project comes from 
the thesis written by Snell [1]. In his work, he collected and estimated the
data from multiple source including all major aero-astro research and develop
institude around the world. Also, the method to model the dynamics of the 
vehicle and the controller implemented including the NDI and Gain Scheduling 
also came from his thesis.              
    The quaternion kinematics mainly reference to the toturial paper done by 
Trawny [2], where he collected and organized all fundamental properties and
mathematical operation of such system.                   
    This model is released to improve our ability to understand and develop 
control methodology of aerial vehicle system similar to this one. It is 
released free of charge now and always will be so in the hope of sharing the
knowledge as much as possible and making this world a better place. 
    However, despite my greatest effort to ensure the correctness of the 
code, it is not garantee to be free of bug or other issue. You are free to 
use and modify the program to meet your need but I'm not responsible for any
potential risk or damaged of any kind.
    Long live and prosper
